Lack of time to manage health (diet/exercise).

Inconsistent tracking of fitness or mental well-being.

Overwhelming number of generic fitness apps that don't feel personalized.

Problem Statements

"Busy professionals need a way to maintain a consistent health routine because their tight schedules prevent them from tracking or managing wellness effectively, which results in poor health outcomes and low motivation."

Methods Chosen

User Interviews: To gather in-depth insights into daily routines, struggles, and preferences.

Surveys: To collect data from a broader audience regarding habits and expectations from a health app.
